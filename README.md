# PortfolioAnalyzer

This package contains the tools I use to analyze stocks and portfolios. The package is pip installable. So you can use it typing

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Tokukawa/PortfolioAnalyzer.git
```

Take a look at the [jupyter examples](Examples.ipynb) to see what you can do with this package.

Namaste.
